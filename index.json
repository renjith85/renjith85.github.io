	"content": "A programmers notebook We all learn and solve so many problems daily using various tools, techologies, languages etc. And as programmers we normally store such information in our notebooks or some files and eventually search for that information whenver we require those. Basically these act us our back up memory tapes when we want to go back and reference things which we might have used once.\nAs we are playing catch up with technology daily and with reach of global information access, it is very important that we share our learnings and findings with others. This creates a feedback loop where we consume and produce information (however small it may be), it will be useful to another programmer. We all are here to share and learn from each other. Hopefully this notebook of mine will be useful to others.\n"

	"content": "SSL(TLS) Certificates SSL and TLS are both cryptographic protocols that provide authentication and data encryption between servers, machines and applications operating over a network (e.g. a client connecting to a web server). SSL is the predecessor to TLS.\n SSL 2.0 =\u0026gt; 1995 SSL 3.0 =\u0026gt; 1996 TLS 1.0 =\u0026gt; 1999 TLS 1.1 =\u0026gt; 2006 TLS 1.2 =\u0026gt; 2008 TLS 1.3 =\u0026gt; 2018  Certificates are not the same as protocols. Certificates are not dependent on protocols. That is, you don’t need to use a TLS Certificate vs. an SSL Certificate. While many vendors tend to use the phrase “SSL/TLS Certificate”, it may be more accurate to call them “Certificates for use with SSL and TLS\u0026rdquo;, since the protocols are determined by your server configuration, not the certificates themselves.\nIt’s likely you will continue to see certificates referred to as SSL Certificates because at this point that’s the term more people are familiar with, but we’re beginning to see increased usage of the term TLS across the industry. SSL/TLS is a common compromise until more people become familiar with TLS.\nThis chapter will provide some details around common tools and usecases for SSL/TLS certificate management in linux environments and in some application frameworks like Java\n"

In this clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history.Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.\n"

	"content": "A Fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built with love by spf13 and friends in Go.\nWebsite | Forum | Chat | Documentation | Installation Guide | Twitter\n   \nOverview Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, easy use and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.\nHugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for meta data. And you can run Hugo from any directory. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.\nHugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second. A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.\nHugo is meant to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles and docs.\nSupported Architectures Currently, we provide pre-built Hugo binaries for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OS X (Darwin) for x64, i386 and ARM architectures.\nHugo may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9 and Solaris.\nComplete documentation is available at Hugo Documentation.\nChoose How to Install If you want to use Hugo as your site generator, simply install the Hugo binaries. The Hugo binaries have no external dependencies.\nTo contribute to the Hugo source code or documentation, you should fork the Hugo GitHub project and clone it to your local machine.\nFinally, you can install the Hugo source code with go, build the binaries yourself, and run Hugo that way. Building the binaries is an easy task for an experienced go getter.\nInstall Hugo as Your Site Generator (Binary Install) Use the installation instructions in the Hugo documentation.\nClone the Hugo Project (Contributor)   Make sure your local environment has the following software installed:\n Git Mercurial Go 1.3+ (Go 1.4+ on Windows, see Go Issue #8090)    Fork the Hugo project on GitHub.\n  Clone your fork:\n git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/hugo    Change into the hugo directory:\n cd hugo    Install the Hugo project’s package dependencies:\n go get -u -v github.com/spf13/hugo    Use a symbolic link to add your locally cloned Hugo repository to your $GOPATH, assuming you prefer doing development work outside of $GOPATH:\n rm -rf \u0026quot;$GOPATH/src/github.com/spf13/hugo\u0026quot; ln -s `pwd` \u0026quot;$GOPATH/src/github.com/spf13/hugo\u0026quot;  Go expects all of your libraries to be found in$GOPATH.\n  Build and Install the Binaries from Source (Advanced Install) Add Hugo and its package dependencies to your go src directory.\ngo get -v github.com/spf13/hugo  Once the get completes, you should find your new hugo (or hugo.exe) executable sitting inside $GOPATH/bin/.\nTo update Hugo’s dependencies, use go get with the -u option.\ngo get -u -v github.com/spf13/hugo  Contributing to Hugo We welcome contributions to Hugo of any kind including documentation, themes, organization, tutorials, blog posts, bug reports, issues, feature requests, feature implementation, pull requests, answering questions on the forum, helping to manage issues, etc. The Hugo community and maintainers are very active and helpful and the project benefits greatly from this activity.\n\nIf you have any questions about how to contribute or what to contribute please ask on the forum\nCode Contribution Guideline We welcome your contributions. To make the process as seamless as possible, we ask for the following:\n Go ahead and fork the project and make your changes. We encourage pull requests to discuss code changes. When you’re ready to create a pull request, be sure to:  Have test cases for the new code. If you have questions about how to do it, please ask in your pull request. Run go fmt Squash your commits into a single commit. git rebase -i. It’s okay to force update your pull request. This blog article is a good resource for learning how to write good commit messages, the most important part being that each commit message should have a title/subject in imperative mode without trailing period: \u0026ldquo;Return error on wrong use of the Paginator\u0026rdquo;, NOT \u0026ldquo;Returning some error.\u0026quot; Also, if your commit references one or more GitHub issues, always end your commit message body with See #1234 or Fixes #1234. Replace 1234 with the GitHub issue ID. The last example will close the issue when the commit is merged into master. Make sure go test ./... passes, and go build completes. Our Travis CI loop (Linux) and AppVeyor (Windows) will catch most things that are missing.    Building Hugo with Your Changes cd /path/to/hugo go build -o hugo main.go mv hugo /usr/local/bin/  Adding compile information to Hugo When Hugo is built using the above steps, the version sub-command will include the mdate of the Hugo executable, similar to the following:\nHugo Static Site Generator v0.13-DEV buildDate: 2014-12-24T04:46:03-07:00  Instead, it is possible to have the version sub-command return information about the git commit used and time of compilation using build flags.\nTo do this, replace the go build command with the following (replace /path/to/hugo with the actual path):\ngo build -ldflags \u0026quot;-X /path/to/hugo/hugolib.CommitHash `git rev-parse --short HEAD 2\u0026gt;/dev/null` -X github.com/spf13/hugo/hugolib.BuildDate `date +%FT%T%z`\u0026quot;  This will result in hugo version output that looks similar to:\nHugo Static Site Generator v0.13-DEV-8042E77 buildDate: 2014-12-25T03:25:57-07:00  Alternatively, just run make — all the “magic” above is already in the Makefile. :wink:\nRunning Hugo cd /path/to/hugo go install github.com/spf13/hugo/hugolib go run main.go  Complete documentation is available at Hugo Documentation.\n \n"

So small reusable collections can be created and copied over to various other test collections, thus promoting reuse.\n  Environment \u0026amp; global configurations: Postman can variablize and use values from environment specific tests. Environment specific values are of utmost importance as the same tests can be reused while your code propagates through various phases\n  Pre request Set up: Each request can be primed or data setup before the actual API request based on parameters.\n  Post request Assertions Once the API request is complete, assertions can be done on response data to ensure it matches the expected result.\n  Command line \u0026amp; GUI Postman provides a command line equivalent called newman, which is a must have as you embedd postman workflow tests into your automated workflows etc.\n  Result reports publishing Postman has a good ecosystem for reports publishing and lot of contribution on various types of reports used with different CI/CD tools\n     "

	"content": "GIT Create Tag To create a tag on your current branch, run this:\n git tag \u0026lt;tagname\u0026gt;\n This will create a local tag with the current state of the branch you are on. When pushing to your remote repo, tags are NOT included by default. You will need to explicitly say that you want to push your tags to your remote repo:\n git push origin —tags\n   Note  This command will push all the tags in your local machine. Try to avoid using this unless you want to purposefully push all the tags available on your machine. One of the problems could be someone could have removed remote tags, but you will repush tags from your local repo, in case you had pulled it down before deletion     Or if you just want to push a single tag:\n git push origin \u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;\n   "

	"content": "GIT Delete Local/Remote Tag Its quite common during a release process or a tag process, you will need to retag a specific version or remove a tag that was already pushed to remote branch.\n To remove a tag if it has been pushed to remote repository\n git push --delete origin tagname\n If you also need to delete the local tag, use:\n git tag --delete tagname\n Dissecting what happened above Pushing a branch, tag, or other ref to a remote repository involves specifying \"push where, what source, what destination?\"\n git push where-to-push source-ref:destination-ref\n A real world example where you push your master branch to the origin\u0026#8217;s master branch is:\n git push origin refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master\n Which because of default paths, can be shortened to:\n git push origin master:master\n Tags work the same way:\n git push origin refs/tags/release-1.0:refs/tags/release-1.0 which can also be shortened to:\n git push origin release-1.0:release-1.0\n By omitting the source ref (the part before the colon), you push 'nothing' to the destination, deleting the ref on the remote end.\n git push origin release-1.0:release-1.0\n    "
